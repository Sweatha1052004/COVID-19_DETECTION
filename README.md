**COVID-19 Detection using X-ray Images**
OVERVIEW
This project aims to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of X-ray images that are classified into categories such as "COVID-19", "Pneumonia", and "Normal". The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify the images.

FEATURES
COVID-19 Detection: Detects the presence of COVID-19 from X-ray images.
Model Training: Uses deep learning techniques for image classification.
User-friendly Interface: Allows easy interaction with the model for inference.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation.

REQUIREMENTS
Before you begin, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch
OpenCV
Matplotlib
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Keras (if using TensorFlow)
You can install the dependencies by running:


pip install -r requirements.txt

DATASETS
The dataset used for training consists of chest X-ray images classified into three categories:
COVID-19
Pneumonia
Normal
The images are collected from publicly available datasets like Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) and other COVID-19 related image datasets.

MODEL ARCHITECTURE
The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification. The model is designed to identify COVID-19 from chest X-ray images with high accuracy. You can customize the architecture or use a pre-trained model (like ResNet or VGG) for fine-tuning.

TRAINING THE MODEL
To train the model, run the following command:

python train.py

Ensure that the dataset is properly organized in folders according to their classes (COVID-19, Pneumonia, Normal).

TRAINING CONFIGURATION
Batch size: 32
Epochs: 10
Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
Inference (Prediction)
To make predictions on a new X-ray image, run:


python predict.py --image path_to_image

This will output the predicted class (COVID-19, Pneumonia, or Normal) and the corresponding probability.

EVALUATION
To evaluate the model on the test dataset, use the following command:
python evaluate.py
This will display the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the model.
